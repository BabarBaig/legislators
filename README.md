Get demographic information about our legislators in Congress

/**
 * Week 3: Intro to Javascript
 * Lab 2: Congress Search
 * File: *** legis1s-current.json *** Click for more options (1.399 MB)
 *
 * For this lab, you will be doing some basic file reading, string manipulation, 
 * and data parsing on a JSON file. The file you will be reading is 
 * legis1s-current.json: this file contains information about all of the 
 * members of the congress of the United States.
 * 
 * Your job will be to use NodeJS to read the lines of this file into a list of 
 * data objects, then use some basic searching and filtering to answer a few 
 * questions about congresspeople.
 * 
 * I want you to answer the following questions:
 * 1] Who are the oldest and youngest members of the Senate?
 * 2] What parties do they belong to?
 * 3] Who are the oldest and youngest members of the House of Representatives?
 * 4] What parties do they belong to?
 * 5] What is the average age of congresspeople for each party? MDN: date-class
 *    date.now, date.parse.
 * 6] One other question of your choosing (maybe using the gender field, or the 
 *    state field, or any of the other attributes of each congressperson....)
 * 7] In a loop, accept first/last name of a legislator and provide demographic
 *    information about them.
 * 
 * Strategy:
 * You will use the require function to open the file and read its contents into
 * a list. Once you have the list of all congresspeople objects, you will need 
 * to use some combination of sorting and looping to find the answer to the 
 * questions above. Use console.log() to print those answers out onto the terminal.
 * 
 * Once you've obtained your answers, upload your .js file to this assignment, 
 * and paste the answers into the chat submission.
